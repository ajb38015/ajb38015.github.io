  <p>Hi! My name is Alex and I am currently a fourth-year mathematics graduate student at the University of Georgia. My advisor is Professor Weiwei Hu. I like to think of myself as an applied pure mathematician,
    as in I am interested in the pure mathematics problems motivated by the real-world. More specifically, I am interested in optimal control theory of transport systems. 
  </p>
  <p> When I am not doing math, you can catch me on stage at the community theatre or playing my instruments.</p>
