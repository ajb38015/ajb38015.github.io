    <p>My current work is focused on designing feedback controllers for networks and analyzing the stability of their transport systems. This can be modelled by considering an arbitrary directed graph
      with distributions along the edges with certain velocities. Using transport equations to illustrate the flow, we can build semigroups and examine the spectrum for different set-ups. Previously, 
      I have worked on repairable systems and boundary control problems. 
    
      Below I have listed my previous and current works. Reach out if you would like to discuss any of them further!</p>
